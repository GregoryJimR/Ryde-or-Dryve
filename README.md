# Ryde-or-Dryve
Project 1
Ryde-or-Dryve helps users decide on their mode of transport - using a ride sharing app or driving their personal vehicle. 
The user inputs their current location - manually or with their browser location service, as well as their person vehicle type or known MPG.
The app will outpu the drive time, compare the cost of UBer and Lyft, and display the cost compared to the cost of driving themselves.
